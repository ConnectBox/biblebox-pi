# Openresolv, by default, wants to update /etc/resolv.conf to use dnsmasq
#  as a local resolver. We stop it from doing that with resolvconf=NO
# If 127.0.0.1 is a system resolver when dnsmasq is running, all on-box
#  queries are answered with the local client-facing ip address. This breaks
#  apt updates and other stuff that needs a working resolver. This means that
#  clients get different results to their DNS queries (which are served
#  from dnsmasq) from queries run on-box i.e. using system resolver
#
#  This does not work with the openresolv that ships with raspbian-lite
#   based on jessie, which is why we need to upgrade it below
