1. _Optional_: Change the name of the wireless network. (Configure -> SSID). When you do this, you will be disconnected from the wireless network and will need to localte and join the newly named wireless network
1. _Optional_: Change the WiFi channel. (Configure -> Channel)

# Content

- This assumes you are placing your content on a USB stick.
- The ConnectBox will display an appropriate icon for each folder on your USB stick when you are browsing content. If you want an specific icon to appear for a folder, instead of the folder name, choose an icon from the [icon list](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and give your folder the same name as the icon. For example, if you want to use the [address book icon](http://fontawesome.io/icon/address-book), your folder should be named _address-book_
- When you insert your USB stick into the ConnectBox, content will automatically be visible in the ConnectBox web interface (this is http://connectbox.local unless the system name has been changed during Initial Administration)
- To update the files on the USB stick, go to the Configure Menu in Administration area, then go to System and press "Unmount USB", then remove the USB stick from the ConnectBox
